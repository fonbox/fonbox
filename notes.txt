known bugs / incompatabilities
* cannot navigator.getUserMedia on Google app on iPhone (but works via Safari)


TODO:
* check user's browser and device before continue
* only allow good_browsers and good_devices
* see browser compatability https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream
* good_devices only include mobile devices, no laptops allowed... or maybe... hmmmm.... is FonBox a fun box if a laptop is inside?
