# FonBox
put your phone in the box and have fun

### Why is this a thing?
Class project for Professor Fred Abler's CSC 484 (User-Centered Interface Design and Development)

### How does (will) it work?
Upon interacting with a cardboard box, a QR code will invite a user to participate by scanning the code. Then the user will be able to access a web interface. The web interface will instruct the user to put the phone in the box. Finally, the phone will serve as a brain in the box using its input and output accessories to interact with the user.
