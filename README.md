# FonBox
put your phone in the box and have fun

## Why is this a thing?
[Class project][class_spreadsheet] for Professor Fred Abler's CSC 484 (User-Centered Interface Design and Development)

### Basic Instructions
> 1) Make a 12"x12"x12" cardboard box, or can be other materials.
> 2) Give Box an AFFORDANCE, which is a clear invitation to participate. Box may also have additional affordances to keep the user participating (i.e. to make it sticky). Don't forget about emotional aspects as well.
> 3) Make your AFFORDANCE 'sticky' so that people want to use your box as long as possible.

## How does (will) it work?
Upon interacting with a cardboard box, a QR code will invite a user to participate by scanning the code. Then the user will be able to access a web interface. The web interface will instruct the user to put the phone in the box. Finally, the phone will serve as a brain in the box using its input and output accessories to interact with the user. 

## Is there a box in real life?
### Here is an image of version 1 of the FonBox

## Why is the name weird?
The "funbox" username on GitHub is already taken... [that's just the way it is ðŸŽµ][the_way_it_is]
